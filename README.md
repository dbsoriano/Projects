# Projects
These couple projects are different things that I have worked on in while in college as an Intern for the UC Davis Facilities Management team. 

- DataForWorkOrder is my most recent project. It is a jupyter notebook in which I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis for work order data provided to me from UC Davis Facilities Managment

- MLPractice File is a python file that I worked with a data from a building on campus in which I did exploratory Data Analysis, 
Cleaned the data, and split the data, I also created models showing usage of chilled water in buildings and how much it should be using.

- TestCode/auto_run_ele_tag files are two files that work together. I wrote all of the TestCode file, and improved the auto_run_ele_tag
file to run more efficiently. The code stores a years worth of hourly data of electricity usage of different buildings on the UC Davis
campus.

- interntest file is a Jupyter notebook file that I used as a way to test my abilities to use python to produce models and graphs of 
temperature needs of buildings around the UC Davis campus.
